      <p><a class="linkcolour" href="https://jobs.csiro.au/job/Canberra,-ACT-ICT-Team-Leader-Canberra-Deep-Space-Communication-Complex/934565510/">This advertised position of ICT Team Leader at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex</a><sup>1</sup> combines my interest in IT along with my interest in science / astronomy. I have attached a PDF of it <a class="linkcolour" href="docs/ICT Team Leader - Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> in case the job ad is removed.</p>
      <p>The position involves leading the ICT Team - supporting hardware, intranet and network infrastructure, IT security and telecommunications. Combining my current career in telecommunications, personal interests in IT support, and having an astronomical environment sounds quite ideal.</p>
      <p>The requirements include: a degree in a related IT field (or equivalent experience); experience with managing ICT systems, assets and budgets, including service reporting; leadership experience of a similar background; ability to read, analyse and interpret professional journals, technical publications and reports, and procedure manuals.</p>
      <p>I have experience with the additional requirements of: fostering teamwork and developing effective working relationships; being self-motivating and committed to providing quality work on-time; being able to exercise sound judgement and act on initiative under pressure; a driverâ€™s licence.</p>
      <p>To gain the skills required for this position I will need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology, as currently planned. I will also need to gain some experience in ICT management, followed by leadership. Exposure to technical publications and manuals will be necessary, either in the ICT position(s) or as an activity outside of work.</p>
