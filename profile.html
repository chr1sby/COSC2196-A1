      <h2><span class="underline">Personal Profile</span></h2>
      <p>To gain an insight into my strengths and weaknesses, I have completed three online tests.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="panel main">
        <h3>1. Myers-Briggs Test<sup>1</sup></h3>
        <p>The result of this test states that my personality type is ‘Logistician’ - ISTJ-T. “Logisticians are practical and fact-minded individuals, whose reliability cannot be doubted.”</p>
        <p>The Myers-Briggs Test informs me that some of my strengths are being honest, dutiful, responsible, calm and practical. My weaknesses include being stubborn, insensitive, by the book, and judgemental.</p>
        <p>In a team I’m likely to crave responsibility, but may be reluctant to give up responsibilities when overburdened. I like structure and rules, so will work best when tasks are clearly defined and delegated. I may be sensitive to criticism, but also be punctual and deliver on-time.</p>
        <p>I will need to be mindful to join a team with some people who think more creatively when brainstorming, and can provide some structure and probably leadership. I will be reliable in a role that requires me to complete defined tasks to a clear schedule.</p>
        <p>The results do appear to match my personality as I know it, so I have some degree of trust that this well-known personality test has some useful insights.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel main">
        <h3>2. Learning Style Test<sup>2</sup></h3>
        <p>The result from this learning style test tells me that I am a Visual Learner. This means that I remember what I see over what I hear and that I prefer to read/write rather than listen to information.</p>
        <p>Optimal ways of learning would be to take notes, using flow charts, mind maps and diagrams. I should place these notes on the walls in my study area. Using colour and images in my notes would also be beneficial. Distractions are to be avoided while learning, e.g. TV.</p>
        <p>While forming a team I will use this information to make sure others are happy to use visual aids while communicating - e.g. a shared whiteboard. Having team members who are patient with describing their ideas visually, rather than only verbally, would also be beneficial.</p>
        <p>From past experience I have indeed adopted many of these learning methods in everyday life, so I believe this test was fairly accurate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel main">
        <h3>3. Team Roles Test<sup>3</sup></h3>
        <p>The results of the Team Roles Test indicate that the top 3 roles that suit me best are:</p>
        <p>Completer - which means I am conscientious and feel responsible for the team’s achievements. I tend to worry and be concerned when errors are made. Most effective at the end of a task, to polish and scrutinise the work for errors.</p>
        <p>Team Player - which is described as caring, avoids conflicts and fosters harmony. I like to help others and am agreeable and friendly. Diplomatic and emphasises solidarity and team cohesion.</p>
        <p>Expert - Work best on a specific task, with strong focus but may get defensive when others interfere. I prefer to work alone and others have trust and confidence in me.</p>
        <p>The results also show the bottom 3 roles include tasks such as co-ordinating, improvising, presenting ideas, developing new contacts, being a motivator, and challenging others.</p>
        <p>While choosing from peers to work in a team I should ensure that there is at least one person who is best suited at co-ordinating, and make it known what my strengths are within the team.</p>
        <p>Some of these results are quite accurate indeed, which is surprising as they are fairly specific at times. This test does seem to reliably tell me what roles in a team suit me best.</p>
